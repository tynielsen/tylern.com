Key Takeaways:
- Ci/CD example
- TailwindCSS example (home page only)
- Fully responsive
- Vanilla JavaScript
- File compression coming soon (minified files, intended more as an intro to compilers)

TylerN.com follows CI/CD and is a work in progress. It serves as my portfolio website, but the idea is for it to become something that anyone can draw from. I'll decide how best to handle content that only I need. Maybe JSON.

The home page uses tailwind.css, but everywhere else is completely custom CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. No frameworks, libraries, or dependencies outside of what browsers provide. The home page is the only exception, regarding CSS.

So this will load and work without having to run or compile anything. To compile updated minified files, refer to the "Install" and "Usage" sections of this readme file.

## Install
Right now, no dependencies! Chances are good that some branches will use some libraries and `npm install`. So the `example` branch will follow this README as a fallback. Branch `main` will include compiled files.
```javascript
// In terminal (CLI) run the following:

// coming soon
```

### Usage

### API
Coming Soon.

### Security
Currently, no security is necessary.

*This README will actively updated as changes are made.
