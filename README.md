Key Takeaways:
- Ci/CD example
- TailwindCSS example (home page only)
- Fully responsive
- Vanilla JavaScript
- File compression coming soon (minified files, intended more as an intro to compilers)

TylerN.com is my own custom CI/CD work-in-progress. It serves as my portfolio website, but the idea is for it to become something that anyone can use. So! Feel free to poke around and if you see something you like, help yourself and enjoy.

It uses tailwind.css on the home page and completely custom CSS and Vanilla JavaScript everywhere else. No framework, no additional libraries outside of what browsers provide. The home page is the only exception, regarding CSS.

This README is also under construction and will be updated as changes are made. This is a CI/CD example as well.
